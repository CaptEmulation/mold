# Introduction

`service-builder` is a dependency injection and service factory framework.

# Usage

```
import builder from 'service-builder;

const blueprint = builder({
  breakfast: function (meat, eggs, drink) {
    return `${meat} with ${eggs} and ${drink}`;
  },
  eggs: eggStyle => `${eggStyle} eggs`,
  solids: (meat, eggs) => [meat, eggs].join(', ')
});

const factory = blueprint.construct();

factory
  .withMeat('ham')
  .withEggStyle('scrambled')
  .withDrink('orange juice')
  .getBreakfast();
// => 'ham with scrambled eggs and orange juice'

const anotherFactory = blueprint.construct({
  meat: 'sausage'
})
  .withEggStyle('scrambled');

anotherFactory.getSolids();
// => 'ham, scrambled eggs'

anotherFactory.getEggs();
// => 'scrambled eggs'

anotherFactory.getBreakfast();
// => Error
```
# Lazy properties
Instead of using the getter functions, there are also lazily evaluated properties on the factory

```
const blueprint = builder({
  eggs: eggStyle => `${eggStyle} eggs`,
});
const factory = blueprint.construct({
  eggStyle: 'fried',
});
console.log(factory.eggs);
// => 'fried eggs'
```

# Implicit properties
If a non-function non-array is passed in as a dependency, then it will be implicitly wrapped in a function.

```
const blueprint = builder({
  foo: bar => `foo${bar}`,
  bar: 'bar',  
});
const factory = blueprint.construct();
console.log(factory.foo);
// => 'foobar'
```

# Resolver

`$` is a resolver for dependencies

```
const blueprint = builder({
  eggs: eggStyle => `${eggStyle} eggs`,
  meat: meatStyle => `${meatStyle} steak`,
});
const factory = blueprint.construct({
  eggStyle: 'fried',
  meatStyle: 'rare',
});
console.log(factory.$((meat, eggs) => `${eggs} and ${meat}`));
// => 'fried eggs and rare steak'
```

Alternatively, you can forgo the DSL syntax of the constructed factory entirely in favor of a resolver:

```
builder.config({ dsl: false });
const blueprint = builder({
  eggs: eggStyle => `${eggStyle} eggs`,
  meat: meatStyle => `${meatStyle} steak`,
});
const $ = blueprint.construct({
  eggStyle: 'fried',
  meatStyle: 'rare',
});
console.log($((meat, eggs) => `${eggs} and ${meat}`));
// => 'fried eggs and rare steak'
```

# Async

If any dependencies return a promise, then the promise will be resolved before being used as dependency.  A side effect of this behavior is that any service that depends on a promise will also return a promise.

```
import builder from 'service-builder;

const blueprint = builder({
  breakfast: function (meat, eggs, drink) {
    return `${meat} with ${eggs} and ${drink}`;
  },
  // Get eggs async
  eggs: eggStyle => Promise.resolve(`${eggStyle} eggs`),
  solids: (meat, eggs) => [meat, eggs].join(', ')
});

const factory = blueprint.construct();

factory
  .withMeat('ham')
  .withEggStyle('scrambled')
  .withDrink('orange juice')
  .getBreakfast()
  .then(console.log);
// => 'ham with scrambled eggs and orange juice'

const anotherFactory = blueprint.construct()
  .withMeat('ham')
  .withEggStyle('scrambled');

anotherFactory.getSolids()
  .then(console.log);
// => 'ham, scrambled eggs'

anotherFactory.getEggs()
  .then(console.log);
// => 'scrambled eggs'

anotherFactory.getBreakfast()
  .then(console.log);
// => Error

```

# Surviving Uglification

Minification / uglifying code mangles variable names which breaks being able to resolve dependencies from function names.  The fix is the same as Angular, to use array style dependencies.  The example above can be written as follows in order to survive minifcation.

```
import builder from 'service-builder;

const blueprint = builder({
  breakfast: ['meat', 'eggs', 'drink', function (meat, eggs, drink) {
    return `${meat} with ${eggs} and ${drink}`;
  }],
  eggs: ['eggStyle', eggStyle => `${eggStyle} eggs`],
  solids: ['meat', 'egg', (meat, eggs) => [meat, eggs].join(', ')]
});

const factory = blueprint.construct();

// Everything continues to work as before, except you can now safely uglify code
factory
  .withMeat('ham')
  .withEggStyle('scrambled')
  .withDrink('orange juice')
  .getBreakfast();
// => 'ham with scrambled eggs and orange juice'

const anotherFactory = blueprint.construct()
  .withMeat('steak')
  .withEggStyle('pouched');

anotherFactory.getSolids();
// => 'steak, pouched eggs'

anotherFactory.getEggs();
// => 'puched eggs'

anotherFactory.getBreakfast();
// => Error unable to resolve drink at breakfast
```
